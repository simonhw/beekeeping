## User Experience

### Initial Discussion
West Cork Beekeeping is a site that promotes interest in beekeeping in the West Cork area. The goal of the site is to generate interest in the environmental importance of the honey bee and encourage visitors to the site to register for beekeeping courses run by the owners of the website. The owners raise funding to keep promoting awareness of the honey bee by running for-profit training courses and selling a small range of relevant products. 

### User Stories

#### First-time Visitor Goals
* To understand what the purpose of the website is.
* To easily navigate between the pages and find what I'm looking for.
* To be able to contact the owners of the website for more information.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
* To be able to easily locate information previously found.
* To find up to date information on beekeeping courses.
* To find out where the website owners are based.
* To be able to purchase beekeeping equipment I need.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals
* To be able to purchase honey when I need to.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
The website uses a palette of simple colours inkeeping with its minimalist design, loosely inspired by the colours found on the body of the honey bee.

![Coolors Palette](assets/images/readme/wbc-coolors-palette.png)

### Typography
An imported Google Font, Alegreya Sans, was used for this website. Font weights of 400 and 700 were chosen for standard and bold text options. This particular font was chosen as it evoked feelings of a friendly and welcoming nature. 

![Alegreya Sands font 400 weight](assets/images/readme/alegreya-sans-400.PNG)
![Alegreya Sands font 700 weight](assets/images/readme/alegreya-sans-700.PNG)

### Imagery
Imagery was chosen that showed beekeepers working with the types of equipment that users would expect to see if they enrol in a beekeeping course. It was difficult to find free-to-use images that showed environment reflecting the local climate of West Cork, so this was rated as a lower priority characteristic compared to finding images that showed people enjoying themselves and that were different enough from each other to not have to repeat any across the site.

### Wireframes
Some basic wireframes were created for desktop and mobile for the the homepage. This gave a basic starting point from which the greater website then took shape. The original ideas were adapted and evolved as coding progressed thoughtout the project timeline. 

![Balsamiq Wireframe for Desktop](assets/images/readme/desktop-wireframe-1.PNG)
![Balsamiq Wireframe for Desktop](assets/images/readme/desktop-wireframe-2.PNG)
![Balsamiq Wireframe for Mobile](assets/images/readme/mobile-wireframe.PNG)

### Features
The website is comprised of six pages. Three are accessible from the main navigation bar: the Home page, Courses page, and Shop Page. The fourth is the Form page, accessible via the call to action button at the bottom of each of the above three pages, and also via links in the list of available courses. The Fifth page is the Thank You page which the user sees once they complete the form itself. The sixth and final page is a 404 page.

#### All pages on the website have:
- A favicon of a honey bee.

![Honey Bee Favicon](assets/images/readme/favicons.PNG)

- A navigation bar at the top allowing the user to move between the three main pages. As there are only three pages, the same format is used for the navigation bar on mobile screens. It was decided that the use of a dropdown menu by clicking a burger icon detracted from the aesthetic look of the header with its background image and centred heading.

![Navigation Bar screenshot](assets/images/readme/navigation-bar.PNG)

- A footer at the bottom of the page containing three icon links to a phone number, email, and Google Maps location. This was determined to be more beneficial to the user than social media links and tied in well with the goals of the website to encourage users to get in touch and register for beekeeping courses.

![Footer screenshot](assets/images/readme/footer.PNG)

#### The Home page
- A heading welcomes the user to the site followed by a summary of the motivation and intentions of the website owners. This immediately gives the user an idea of what to expect from the rest of the website. A picture of three beekeepers posing in their suits conveys a sense of fun and camaraderie to the user.

![About Us screenshot](assets/images/readme/section-about-us.PNG)

- A section briefly describes the role honey bees play in the environment and the challenges currently faced by them. This section ends with a call-to-action of sorts and places at the front of the user's mind the idea that becoming a beekeeper is a noble and worthwhile pursuit. A closeup image of a bee collecting nectar from a flower is nestled between the two paragraphs of this section. Its bright colours and focus on the bee itself should evoke thoughts about the beauty and importance of the honey bee in nature while also making the user think about its fragility as a small creature worthy of our care.

![About Bees screenshot](assets/images/readme/section-about-bees.PNG)

- A third and final section consists of two sets of short descriptive sentences and associated images and headings. These two sections invite the user to either navigate to the Courses page to learn more about the beekeeping courses, or to visit the Shop page to purchase honey. The images are the links, and when viewed on mobiles and tablets, the final sentence says "*Tap the image to learn more*", while on desktops it says "*Click the image the learn more*". This was achieved with the use of spans.
- At the bottom of this page and the two other main pages, a call-to-action link takes the user directly to the Form page to register for a beekeeping course. This link allows a returning user to navigate directly to the registration form without having to click other links to get there. The yellow colour was chosen to draw attention to the user that it is something distinct from other content on this page.

![Short Descriptions screenshot](assets/images/readme/section-short-descriptions-call-to-action.PNG)

#### The Courses page
- The first section lists the two different levels of courses offered. Beginner courses are listed first with information on the duration and times the courses start. An overview of the structure of the courses follows with distinct boxes listing upcoming courses. The most recent sold out courses at each level are still shown on this page to convey to the user that there is already interest and that they should not delay in booking their place. The Intermediate course information is presented next with the same structure as described above. These sections will be updated as time goes on to keep user up to date with availibility.

![Upcoming Courses screenshot](assets/images/readme/section-courses.PNG)

- A second section aims to convince the undecided user that they should register their interest in an upcoming course. Four reasons to become a beekeeper are listed with accompanying imagery chosen to invoke thoughts of fun, relaxation, peacefulness, and enjoyment.
- A final paragraph reminds the user that becoming a beekeeper requires time and effort but reassures them that it is a worthwhile endeavour.

![Why Become a Beekeeper screenshot](assets/images/readme/section-why.PNG)

#### The Shop page
- An introductory paragraph informs the user of the payment process for products on this page as well as delivery terms and discounts for course graduates. A contact number and email are listed distinct from each other below the paragraph to offer the returning user quick access should they desire to contact the owners.

![Shop screenshot](assets/images/readme/section-shop.PNG)

- Boxes show the available products and short descriptions with accompanying imagery. These boxes will be displayed in single or multiple columns based on the screen width of the user.

![Products screenshot](assets/images/readme/section-products.PNG)

#### The Form page
- A simple layout seeks only the minimum necessary information from the user. This style of layout is intended to make the user experience straightforward and quick, as very few people want to spend time filling out multiple form fields.
- The input fields only accept the expected type of input; the date of birth field does not allow a user under the age of 18 to register.
- Radio buttons limit the user to only registering for one available course at a time. The next available beginner course is selected by default.
- A button underneath the fieldset submits the user's details when clicked; however, it will only allow the user to do so if they have completed all the input fields correctly. If any information is missing or the format is incorrect, the website will direct the user to the problem area.

![Form screenshot](assets/images/readme/section-registration.PNG)

#### The Thank You page

#### The 404 page

#### Features To Be Implemented
- Add mouse hover effect on laptop and dekstop screens: CSS styling will darken the two images at the bottom of index.html and display white text above the darkened area saying "*Learn more about courses*" and "*Browse our shop*" respectively for both images.
- Upgrade the Courses page to allow direct booking of and payment for availble courses.
- Upgrade the Shop page to allow direct ordering and payment via the website.

### Accessibility
When creating this website, I kept accessibility in mind by:
- Using semantic html elements throughout the website.
- Using colours with good contrast to the background.
- Including clearly descriptive alt attributes for all images on the site.
- Using aria labels to describe the actions that would be taken when interacting with links that contain no text. These can be found in the two image links at the bottom of index.html and in the footer icons link on every page.

## Bugs
### Known Bugs
| # | Bug | Image | Plan to Solve |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The four divs in the Why Become a Beekeeper section arrange themselves in a 2x2 grid for screen widths of 768px and greater; however, in some non-standard screen sizes only the fourth div wraps onto the second row and is shown much larger than the other three divs. This bug is unlikely to be encountered by the average user visiting the website on commonly used devices. | ![Navbar padding bug](assets/images/readme/bugs/bug004-why-divs.PNG) | Revisit the problem after learning Javascript and utilise logic to force the divs into a 2x2 grid for the desired screen sizes. |

### Solved Bugs
| # | Bug | Image | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | While creating the navbar unordered list, there was an unspecified left padding of 40px discovered which was pushing the nav links visually off center. | ![Navbar padding bug](assets/images/readme/bugs/bug001-nav-padding.PNG) | The solution was to force all padding for the element to 0px in the CSS stylesheet. |
|2|The first element in the header (the div containing the navbar) has a value of 5px for margin-top. This eemed to result in pushing the entire header down leaving an empty white space equal to 5px in height. | ![Navbar margin bug](assets/images/readme/bugs/bug002-nav-margin.PNG) | Adding the property `overflow:hidden` to the div resolved the problem. Solution found on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2680478/margin-top-push-outer-div-down) |
| 3 | When tilting the mobile screen or using larger width displays, the H1 element was finding itself positioned outside the limits of the header. | ![Navbar H1 position bug](assets/images/readme/bugs/bug003-h1-overflow.PNG) | I set the parent div to `display: flex` to ensure it stayed positioned inside the header and also utilised `flex-grow: 2` to visually centre the H1 in the new flex layout. This also seemed to solve Bug #2 when removing the `overflow:hidden` property added above. |
