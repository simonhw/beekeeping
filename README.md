--- BUGS ---
While creating the nav bar, there was an inexplicable left padding of 40px which pushed the nav links off center when using flex properties. The solution was to force all padding for the element to 0px in the CSS code.

The first element in the header, the div containing the navbar, had a non-zero value for margin-top. This pushed the entire header down leaving a white space in height equal to the previous
margin-top value. Adding the property 'overflow:hidden' to the div resolved the problem.
Solution found on stack overflow here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2680478/margin-top-push-outer-div-down

h1 was being pushed off header until i utilised flex grow and also setting a minimum height for the header.

To-do List:
Add hover effect to nav for mouseover, background grey colour
add hover to bottom two images, black transparency and white text
